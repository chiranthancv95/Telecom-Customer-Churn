# Telecom-Customer-Churn<br/>

Telecom Customer Churn Prediction<br/>
Introduction<br/>
What is Churn rate?<br/>
Churn Rate is a measure of the number of individuals or items moving out of a collective group over a specific period. Customer Churn occurs when there is loss of customers or clients from the service provider especially in the telecommunications industry as the users have multiple options they can opt for in a particular area.<br/>

What problem am I solving here?<br/>
The dataset provides information on the customer behaviour when using the Service. Based on those insights we can know whether the customer churns or not. By training a model based on the dataset, we can predict the shortcomings of the service provider, thereby, we could suggest the service provider to improve those particular services. Thus, reducing the churn rate.<br/>

What's the dataset about?<br/>
The raw data contains 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features). The “Churn” column is our target.<br/>

The features in the dataset indicate the different parameter of a user's behaviour. Some of the parameters include information like whether the user has a dependent, has a partner, is a senior citizen, monthly expenditure charges, has multiple lines, has Paperless billing, registration for services like OnlineBackup, Device Protection, Online Security, Phone Service, Internet Service, StreamingTv, StreamingMovies,etc...<br/>
